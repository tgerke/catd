Summary
---------------------------------------------------------

This is an early shell of software to automatically download and
manually curate expression data, including phenotype/clinical
information and quality control.

One design goal is to separate all the files created or modified by
humans (programmers and curators), from files which can be
automatically generated by the computer:

*lowercase* directories contain files generated by programmers and
 curators, which should be sufficient to download and generate all
 prepared datasets.

*CAPITALIZED* directories contain automatically generated files,
 including the output which will be used.

---------------------------------------------------------
Specific objectives
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Download processed microarray data.

2) Download raw microarray data where available

3) Pre-process raw microarray data - method may depend on microarray
platform, and there may be two or methods for any given platform.

4) Generate QC plots for each dataset

5) Make it easy for a curator to add information specific to each
dataset: curated phenotype data, samples to exclude for quality reasons.

6) Provide options for mappings between feature identifiers, so
end-result datasets are all summarized by the identifier of choice.
It should be easy to update mappints, or look up what mappings were
used for a particular dataset.  Use the *same* mappings all datasets
of a given platform.  Ben Haibe-Kains suggested that the geneSigDB
creators have a lot of experience with this that they could share.

7) Aggregate desired results into a single location in an easy-to-use
format for a biostatistician.  ie, a set of ExpressionSets in a single
directory, or a set of PCL files.  Ben Haibe-Kains made the cool
suggestion to have a final output be the Bioconductor package itself.

Directory structure
---------------------------------------------------------

src: Scripts which must be run to download, preprocess, make QC plots, etc.

shellscripts: shell scripts which call the scripts in src (this job
will later be taken over by AREPA/Scons

curation: manually curated clinical/phenotype data (currently ignored)

qualitycontrol: a file per dataset which has any samples which should
be excluded.  One sample identifier per line. (currently ignored)

doc: documentation

LOG: computer-generated log files

DATA: 
      IDENTIFIER
	QC
	RAW
	PROCESSED
		DEFAULT
		RMA

Svitlana suggested having another level of structure under DATA, for ease of use:

DATA:
	HGU133A
	HGU133PLUS2
	OTHER PLATFORM, ETC

To run the example
---------------------------------------------------------

Go to the shellscripts directory.

Make sure to set OVHOME and REXEC in the setvars file to correct values.

Run the following command for a complete example:

./runall.sh

Or run the commands found in runall.sh one at a time.  Results are
kept in the DATA directory, and logged in the LOG directory.
