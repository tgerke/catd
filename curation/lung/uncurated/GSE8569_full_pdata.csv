Substandard spots were manually flagged and discarded for further analysis.","The Cy5/Cy3 ratios were normalized to the median ratio value using the DNMAD tool, based on a print-tip loess method. The conditions for the normalization were: 1) use negative flags, that means that the flagged spots are not used for the normalization and are turned into missing values; 2) do not use background correction.","The normalized and semi-logarithmic transformed data were preprocessing using GEPAS software. Conditions for data pre-processing were: 1) merge replicates (the Cy5/Cy3 ratios of replicated spots were averaged); 2) filter missing values in order to exclude for further analysis any gene with data missing in more than 10% of the samples.","For unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we used a complete-linkage method with correlation distance. Genes whose expression levels varied by a factor of less than 3 across the samples were eliminated to leave only the mos variably expressed transcripts.The SOTARRAY Clustering Program was used for the hierarchical clustering of the samples and the Gene Cluster/Tree View program was used to view gene expression profiles.","To identify the genes that are important for distinguishing subgroups defined by histological type or gene alterations, we did t-tests with 200.000 random permutations to compute significance. To account for the effect of multiple hypothesis testing on the identification of significance, adjusted P-values were computed to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). The differentially expressed genes were functionaly classified manually on the basis of exhaustive searches in Pubmed an in Gene Ontology databases.","GPL5645","Barbara,,Angulo","bangulo@cnio.es","Lung Cancer Group","Molecular Pathology Program","Spanish National Cancer Centre","Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3","Madrid","28029","Spain","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM212nnn/GSM212693/GSM212693.gpr.gz","27648"

Substandard spots were manually flagged and discarded for further analysis.","The Cy5/Cy3 ratios were normalized to the median ratio value using the DNMAD tool, based on a print-tip loess method. The conditions for the normalization were: 1) use negative flags, that means that the flagged spots are not used for the normalization and are turned into missing values; 2) do not use background correction.","The normalized and semi-logarithmic transformed data were preprocessing using GEPAS software. Conditions for data pre-processing were: 1) merge replicates (the Cy5/Cy3 ratios of replicated spots were averaged); 2) filter missing values in order to exclude for further analysis any gene with data missing in more than 10% of the samples.","For unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we used a complete-linkage method with correlation distance. Genes whose expression levels varied by a factor of less than 3 across the samples were eliminated to leave only the mos variably expressed transcripts.The SOTARRAY Clustering Program was used for the hierarchical clustering of the samples and the Gene Cluster/Tree View program was used to view gene expression profiles.","To identify the genes that are important for distinguishing subgroups defined by histological type or gene alterations, we did t-tests with 200.000 random permutations to compute significance. To account for the effect of multiple hypothesis testing on the identification of significance, adjusted P-values were computed to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). The differentially expressed genes were functionaly classified manually on the basis of exhaustive searches in Pubmed an in Gene Ontology databases.","GPL5645","Barbara,,Angulo","bangulo@cnio.es","Lung Cancer Group","Molecular Pathology Program","Spanish National Cancer Centre","Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3","Madrid","28029","Spain","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM212nnn/GSM212745/GSM212745.gpr.gz","27648"

Conditions for data pre-processing were: 1) merge replicates (the Cy5/Cy3 ratios of replicated spots were averaged); 2) filter missing values in order to exclude for further analysis any gene with data missing in more than 10% of the samples.","For unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we used a complete-linkage method with correlation distance. Genes whose expression levels varied by a factor of less than 3 across the samples were eliminated to leave only the mos variably expressed transcripts.The SOTARRAY Clustering Program was used for the hierarchical clustering of the samples and the Gene Cluster/Tree View program was used to view gene expression profiles.","To identify the genes that are important for distinguishing subgroups defined by histological type or gene alterations, we did t-tests with 200.000 random permutations to compute significance. To account for the effect of multiple hypothesis testing on the identification of significance, adjusted P-values were computed to control for the false discovery rate (FDR).

Substandard spots were manually flagged and discarded for further analysis.","The Cy5/Cy3 ratios were normalized to the median ratio value using the DNMAD tool, based on a print-tip loess method. The conditions for the normalization were: 1) use negative flags, that means that the flagged spots are not used for the normalization and are turned into missing values; 2) do not use background correction.","The normalized and semi-logarithmic transformed data were preprocessing using GEPAS software. Conditions for data pre-processing were: 1) merge replicates (the Cy5/Cy3 ratios of replicated spots were averaged); 2) filter missing values in order to exclude for further analysis any gene with data missing in more than 10% of the samples.","For unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we used a complete-linkage method with correlation distance. Genes whose expression levels varied by a factor of less than 3 across the samples were eliminated to leave only the mos variably expressed transcripts.The SOTARRAY Clustering Program was used for the hierarchical clustering of the samples and the Gene Cluster/Tree View program was used to view gene expression profiles.","To identify the genes that are important for distinguishing subgroups defined by histological type or gene alterations, we did t-tests with 200.000 random permutations to compute significance. To account for the effect of multiple hypothesis testing on the identification of significance, adjusted P-values were computed to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). The differentially expressed genes were functionaly classified manually on the basis of exhaustive searches in Pubmed an in Gene Ontology databases.","GPL5645","Barbara,,Angulo","bangulo@cnio.es","Lung Cancer Group","Molecular Pathology Program","Spanish National Cancer Centre","Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3","Madrid","28029","Spain","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM212nnn/GSM212767/GSM212767.gpr.gz","27648"
