The supernatant was mixed by vigorous shaking with an equal volume (~1-2ml) of 70% alcohol, then transferred to an RNeasy (Qiagen) column and placed on a vacuum. The column was washed with 700μl Buffer RW1 (Qiagen), followed by 2 washes with 500μl Buffer RPE (Qiagen). To ensure the membrane was clean and dry, the RNeasy (Qiagen) column was placed into a 2ml collection tube and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 1 minute. The flow through and collection tube was discarded. Finally, the column was eluted twice with 50ul RNase-free water, with collection of the eluate in a new 1.5ml collection tube. A spectrophotometer was used to measure RNA concentration by estimating absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm. A ratio of <1.8 suggested poor quality RNA and was not used. Purified RNA was precipitated in 0.1 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and stored in a -20C freezer overnight. After centrifuging at 13,000rpm at 4C for 15 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed with 500μl 70% ethanol. The pellet was then resuspended in an appropriate volume of RNase-free water to give a final RNA concentration between 1 – 8ug/μl. A repeat assessment of RNA concentration was performed and samples were stored in -80C until required for transcriptional studies.  RNA yields of approximately 0.5-1.0μg per mg of tissue were typically obtained using this approach.","Reference sample is comprised of pooled RNA from following 11 cell lines: MCF7, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-22; Hs578T, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (stromal-like), adherent, ATCC HTB-126; NTERA2, teratoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC CRL-1973; Colo205, colon tumor-derived cell line, mixed, ATCC CCL-222; OVCAR-3, ovarian tumor-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-161; UACC-62, melanoma-derived cell line, adherent, Stinson et al.

The supernatant was mixed by vigorous shaking with an equal volume (~1-2ml) of 70% alcohol, then transferred to an RNeasy (Qiagen) column and placed on a vacuum. The column was washed with 700μl Buffer RW1 (Qiagen), followed by 2 washes with 500μl Buffer RPE (Qiagen). To ensure the membrane was clean and dry, the RNeasy (Qiagen) column was placed into a 2ml collection tube and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 1 minute. The flow through and collection tube was discarded. Finally, the column was eluted twice with 50ul RNase-free water, with collection of the eluate in a new 1.5ml collection tube. A spectrophotometer was used to measure RNA concentration by estimating absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm. A ratio of <1.8 suggested poor quality RNA and was not used. Purified RNA was precipitated in 0.1 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and stored in a -20C freezer overnight. After centrifuging at 13,000rpm at 4C for 15 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed with 500μl 70% ethanol. The pellet was then resuspended in an appropriate volume of RNase-free water to give a final RNA concentration between 1 – 8ug/μl. A repeat assessment of RNA concentration was performed and samples were stored in -80C until required for transcriptional studies.  RNA yields of approximately 0.5-1.0μg per mg of tissue were typically obtained using this approach.","Reference sample is comprised of pooled RNA from following 11 cell lines: MCF7, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-22; Hs578T, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (stromal-like), adherent, ATCC HTB-126; NTERA2, teratoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC CRL-1973; Colo205, colon tumor-derived cell line, mixed, ATCC CCL-222; OVCAR-3, ovarian tumor-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-161; UACC-62, melanoma-derived cell line, adherent, Stinson et al.

After the addition of 400μl chloroform, the homogenate was shaken vigorously for 30 seconds, then left to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged at 11,000rpm at 4C for 15 minutes. The clear supernatant was carefully removed, without disturbing the interface, and transfered to a clean tube. The supernatant was mixed by vigorous shaking with an equal volume (~1-2ml) of 70% alcohol, then transferred to an RNeasy (Qiagen) column and placed on a vacuum. The column was washed with 700μl Buffer RW1 (Qiagen), followed by 2 washes with 500μl Buffer RPE (Qiagen). To ensure the membrane was clean and dry, the RNeasy (Qiagen) column was placed into a 2ml collection tube and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 1 minute. The flow through and collection tube was discarded. Finally, the column was eluted twice with 50ul RNase-free water, with collection of the eluate in a new 1.5ml collection tube. A spectrophotometer was used to measure RNA concentration by estimating absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm. A ratio of <1.8 suggested poor quality RNA and was not used. Purified RNA was precipitated in 0.1 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and stored in a -20C freezer overnight. After centrifuging at 13,000rpm at 4C for 15 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed with 500μl 70% ethanol. The pellet was then resuspended in an appropriate volume of RNase-free water to give a final RNA concentration between 1 – 8ug/μl. A repeat assessment of RNA concentration was performed and samples were stored in -80C until required for transcriptional studies.  RNA yields of approximately 0.5-1.0μg per mg of tissue were typically obtained using this approach.","Reference sample is comprised of pooled RNA from following 11 cell lines: MCF7, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-22; Hs578T, breast adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (stromal-like), adherent, ATCC HTB-126; NTERA2, teratoma-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC CRL-1973; Colo205, colon tumor-derived cell line, mixed, ATCC CCL-222; OVCAR-3, ovarian tumor-derived cell line, adherent, ATCC HTB-161; UACC-62, melanoma-derived cell line, adherent, Stinson et al.

The slide was immediately placed in the humidified chamber and hybridised at 42C for 14-16 hours.","Between 1 and 6 microarrays were performed at a time.","Washing:","Following hybridisation, slides were washed to remove excess labeled target and reagents. All wash reagents were filtered through a 0.22 µm bottle-top filter and all steps were performed in light-proof containers.","Coverslips were removed by immersion in 50ml of Wash 1 (0.5x SSC and 0.01% SDS) in a glass Coplin jar for approximately 60 seconds. Slides were then placed in a darkened container containing ~250ml of Wash 1 and agitated gently at room temperature for 1 minute. In new darkened containers, slides were washed for 3 minutes with ~250ml of Wash 2 (0.5x SSC), then ~250ml of Wash 3 (0.06x SSC). Wash 3 was repeated for 30 seconds prior to removing slides and drying in a centrifuge (Hareus Megafuge) at 800rpm for 5 minutes.","Scanning of microarrays was performed using a dual laser microarray scanner (model G2505B, Agilent Technologies). The confocal laser used excitatory wavelengths of 532 nm and 635 nm for Cy3 and Cy5 channels, respectively.","Data was presented using Feature Extraction Software (Version 7.5, Agilent Technologies) as a 16-bit TIFF image for each channel, and was reviewed using a pseudo-colour overlay image of the Cy5/Cy3 channels, with red allocated to Cy5 and green to Cy3. The images allowed for visual assessment of spot morphology, signal intensity and background or other staining artifacts.","Genepix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon Instruments) was used to extract data from scanned TIFF images. This program defined each spot by a grid reference and quantified each channel separately. It calculated spot intensity by plotting intensity by area and calculating the area under the curve. The program also identified regions outside the area of maximum intensity as background and recorded this value in another field. For each channel (Cy3 and Cy5) there was a value for mean intensity and mean background, recorded in a text file that could be imported into appropriate software for data analysis and data imaging.","GPL11205","Holger,,Schlueter","holger.schluter@petermac.org","0061393299479","0061396561411","Epithelial Stem Cell Biology Lab","Research","Peter Mac Callum cancer Centre","Locked Bag 1","Melbourne","Victoria","8006","Australia","www.petermac.org","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM623nnn/GSM623324/GSM623324.gpr.gz","9741"
