Next, a model-based PM-only approach established gene expression levels using dChip software.    A modified “semi-supervised” method was applied in two stages: (1) supervised dimension reduction by fitting a univariate Cox model that included a jackknifing step to each gene, so only those genes with a consistently large Cox score were included in the signature. Among 200, 100, or 300 probe sets, 200 yielded an optimally sized predictor; (2) In stage 2, the dimensions of the data set were reduced from 200 to 5 by PC analysis. The number of PCs was set at 5 capturing 90% of the expression data. 4 or 6 PCs were investigated to see whether this parameter affected the results. A prediction model was then built using multivariate Cox regression, where independent variables included the first 5 PCs and debulking status.","Standard leave-one-out validation evaluated the prediction model reserving one sample for testing, and using the remaining 52 patients to establish the prediction model following the method described above. The reserved patient had no contribution to the prediction model yielding 53 separate predicted hazards. Patients were equally divided into low and high-risk groups according to whether their hazard was less or greater than the sample median and were compared by Kaplan Meier analysis with a non-parametric log-rank test.","","GPL570","Michael,,Birrer","mbirrer@partners.org","6177244800","Surgical Oncology Research Labs","Medicine","MGH","70 Blossom Street","Boston","MA","02114","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM461nnn/GSM461348/GSM461348.CEL.gz","54675"
