0.2.0: 
* Added E-MTAB-386 (FFPE samples with survival data)
* put MaxMean probe mappings in eset@featureData
* put official Bioconductor platform names in eset@annotation

0.2.1:
* In the TCGA dataset, about 40 censored patients had days_to_death and days_to_recurrence labelled as NA instead of the follow-up time.
* TCGA released updated clinical information for six patients
* Levi reviewed Ina and Svitlana's double-checks, which resulted in minor changes to GSE18520 (for all patients changed debulking_status from NA -> optimal, stage IV -> III, and grade 4 -> 3)

0.2.2:
* replace GSE17260, which went missing in 0.2.1

0.2.3:
* Rename "celfile_run_date" and "batch_1" to "batch", and get rid of "batch_2" and "batch_3" so there is one consistent batch variable
* consistently label missing debulking status as "NA" rather than sometimes as "unknown"
* for FULL version, replace the missing probesets (probesets not found in the probeset-gene map were missing in previous versions)
* addition of unit test for sample counts (not actually working yet)

0.2.4:
* TCGA: replaced batch variable which disappeared
* GSE9891: corrected days_to_death and days_to_recurrence for three patients where an error occurred in copying uncurated data from supplemental PDF to create source .csv file.

0.3.0:
* Added GSE32062.GPL6480 and GSE32063 (Yoshihara et al. 2012), "Japanese datasets A and B" (issue #6).
* GSE13876: Got rid of recurrence_status, which was just a copy
  of vital_status.  No recurrence status is available for this study.
* resolved missing ExperimentData for GSE2109 and GSE6822 (issue #9)
* Added subtype information (serous) for PMID17290060, PMID19318476, PMID15897565 (issue #11)
* Turned Markus's dataset-check test to R CMD check unit test

0.4.0:
* Added GSE30009 (Taqman qPCR dataset).

0.4.1:
* Added ages to GSE26712 (Bonome 08).
* Use getPlatformsBiomaRt for GSE6822, to avoid using HGNC symbols directly from GPL80 [Hu6800]

0.4.2:
* 0.4.1 actually did not include ages for GSE26712, but this version
does.

0.5.0: 
* disallow the use of "unknown" in template, use NA instead.
Affected subtype, debulking, primarysite, arrayedsite.
* added unit test which does syntax checking against template.

0.9: 

* made distinction between T (1-3) of the TNM staging, and FIGO
tumorstage (I-IV), which we still code as 1-4.  This affected the
metadata for every dataset which has stage.
