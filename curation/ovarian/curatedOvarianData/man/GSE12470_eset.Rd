\title{Gene expression profiling of advanced-stage serous ovarian cancers distinguishes novel subclasses and implicates ZEB2 in tumor progression and prognosis.}
\description{Gene expression profiles from 43 ovarian cancer tissues comprising 8 early stage and 35 advanced stage tissues were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays of 18,716 genes.  5 genes (ZEB2, CDH1, LTBP2, COL16A1 and ACTA2) were extracted as candidates for prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival.  The findings suggest that the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes such as ZEB2 and CDH1 may play important roles in the invasion process of advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer.}
