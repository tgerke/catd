Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 µl) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip® using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.","","","","","","Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

The chip was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses.

Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 µl) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip® using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.","","","","","","Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation. The following selection criteria were applied: all spots having a mean signal (after background subtraction) less than that of the background and below that of the negative controls in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels were systematically excluded; the data were also filtered to exclude spots flagged as missing or corrupted in one array. We next calculated the expression ratios (DATA/REF) in all analyses; the provided VALUE corresponds to the log, base 2 ratios. Replicate spots on the array (n=2) are considered separately.","GPL3282","Sandrine,,Imbeaud","sandrine.imbeaud@inserm.fr","+33 (0)1 53 72 51 98","+33 (0)1 53 72 51 92","Génomique Fonctionnelle des tumeurs solides","INSERM, UMR U-674, Université Paris Descartes","27 rue Juliette Dodu","Paris","75010","France","http://www.inserm-u674.net/","NONE","23232"
