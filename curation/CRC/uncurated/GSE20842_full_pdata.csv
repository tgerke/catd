Nucleic acid quantity, quality and purity were determined using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Rockland, DE) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).","Cy3","1 µg of total RNA was labeled with Cy3 using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Quantity and efficiency of the labeled amplified cRNA were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer version 3.2.1.","9606","1.5 mg of Cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized to an oligonucleotide-based Whole Human Genome Microarray (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) and incubated at 65˚C for 17 hours.","Slides were washed and scanned using an Agilent G2565BA scanner.","Human pretherapeutic rectal cancer patient biopsy sample P167M","Raw data were extracted using the Feature Extraction software version 9.1 (Agilent Technologies). Median signal intensities from the Feature Extraction Software were converted to log2 and quantile normalized using the R package “limma”.","GPL4133","Marian ,,Grade","marian.grade@gmail.com","Surgery","University Medical Center Goettingen, Georg-August-University","Robert-Koch-Str. 40","Goettingen","37075","Germany","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM521nnn/GSM521243/GSM521243.txt.gz","40645"
