curatedBladderData is a comprehensive resource for clinically-oriented
investigation of the bladder cancer transcriptome.  Probesets are mapped to
official gene symbols using up-to-date maps.  All clinical annotations are
hand-curated and machine-checked to ensure consistent syntax and maximum
retention of available clinical variables.  ExpressionSet slots are populated
with numerous metadata including PubMed IDs, citations, abstracts,
study-specific warnings for retractions and duplicated samples, and probeset
<--> gene maps.  The package vignette provides examples for selecting patients
and datasets based on flexible rules, performing meta-analysis of potential
biomarkers, creating publication-ready tables from ExpressionSet metadata, and
simple exporting of data tables for non R-users.
