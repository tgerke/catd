The probes were annotated to HGNC GeneSymbols using the Illumina platform annotation file and probes without gene symbol were discarded. Next, 50% of the probes with lowest intensity were discarded and the remaining probes were mean-centered. Probes annotated with the same gene symbol were merged using the median value for each gene symbol.///data_processing.1: Normalized data in Sample tables below: Original detection p-values, along with expression values arrived at after: background correction, probe-by-probe rescaling adjustment for extraction method, probe-by-probe rescaling adjustment for labeling plate, quantile normalization, Log2 conversion, application of a 50% intensity filter and mean centering of probes.///data_processing.2: Matrix non-normalized (linked as supplementary file on Series record): The raw intensity values subjected only to background correction.///platform_id: GPL6947///contact_name: Gottfrid,,Sjodahl///contact_email: gottfrid.sjodahl@med.lu.se///contact_department: Department of oncology///contact_institute: Lund Univeristy///contact_address: BMC C13///contact_city: Lund///contact_zip.postal_code: SE-22184///contact_country: Sweden///supplementary_file: NONE///data_row_count: 24402"
